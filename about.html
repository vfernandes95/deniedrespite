		<h2>About this site</h2>
		
			<p>The purpose of this website is to track my progress in level design. I create levels mainly for Quake, but I've used editors like Doom Builder and even played around with RPG Maker. It's also a good way to exercise my HTML skills, as I'm not using a CMS or any blog engine.</p>

			<h2>About the author</h2>
			
			<p>I'm Victor, probably better know as vaf. IRL I work with e-learning where I can put my design skills to the test. Despite playing games since I was a child, I'm not an enthusiast of using games in education, though some game elements such as points, rewards and challenges are a much welcoming addition to the learning process.</p>
