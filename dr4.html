		<p>My very first attempt at mapping. I managed to put several cool ideas in this medium sized map, but it is obviously a first timer work. Some of the problems include lack of ammo, bad monster placement (I didn't know how to use triggers back then) and bad lighining. Brushwork is very primitive.
