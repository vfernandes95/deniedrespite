		<p>As I write this post, Steam registers more than 700 hours of Team Fortress 2 in my account. Naturally, and since I had already mapped for Quake, I wanted to give TF2 mapping a go. Unfortunately, I couldn't find out a way to decently run Valve Hammer on Linux, even after installing Steam through Wine, so I decided it would be better to simply demake Dustbowl, the most popular Attack/Defense map in TF2 <sup>[Citation Needed...]</sup>.

		<p>It's still quite flat and boxy, but this is far from finished. Also, there are two more maps to go, as TF2's Dustbowl has 3 sectors.</p>
