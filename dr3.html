		<h2>This box (the box?)</h2>
		<br>
		<p>A very silly same, indeed. It's a remake of the maps Dead Simple and Even Simpler, from Doom II and Doom 64 respectively. I wanted the name it similarly, but Yoder had released a map called Simplex a week before or something... And so there's this map called This Onion, so why not call mine This Box? Quite stupid.  
		</p>
		<p>Gameplay wise, I'm not very proud. I wanted to add some linearity to a arena map, but I didn't work very well. Some people still disliked it for being mostly an arena.</p>
		<p>The map looks good, mainly due to the knave textures. Brushwork is ok, I guess. I added a lot of details, but at the time I was not super familiar with Trenchbroom</p>
